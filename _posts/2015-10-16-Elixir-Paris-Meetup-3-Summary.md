After having been inactive for some time, Elixir Meetup reboot gathering happened last Tuesday in Paris. It gathered quite a large crowd of enthusiastic developers that came to exchange and learn about Elixir programming language.

The talks were a good mix of highly advanced demos and good overview for newcomers. Arnaud Wetzel and Antoine Reyt demoed how to build an robust, scalable and fault-tolerant ad-server. The demo was very impressive and coverage many concept of the Elixir environment, including Erlang supervision process, macros, etc. The result of their work with explanations and screenshot from the demo is published on Github: <a href="https://github.com/ElixirParis/ssp_demo">ElixirParis/ssp_demo</a>.

Following that excellent demo, I (Mickaël Rémond) covered the history of the Elixir programming language and explained the reasons of the success and the key features. Here are the slides of my presentation:

Next Elixir Paris Meetup will take place on November 25th, with a focus on <a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org">Phoenix framework</a>. Given the success of our third meetup, we will need for sure a much bigger room :)
